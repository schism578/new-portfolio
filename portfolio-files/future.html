          <p>My pursuit of a profession in web development is something of a paradigm shift
              and also a serendipitous realization I had, as though I had been preparing for this all of my life. 
              All of the skills and traits I've accumulated over the years has put me in this strategic place at this
              particular time and the pieces and places were all aligned right at the moment I was ready to make the 
              commitment to a new future.</p>
          <p>I'm in that phase of idealizing what I think is quality work, absorbing many concepts
              that may or may not fully make sense, and trying to master their application piece by piece. At the same time,
              I resign myself everyday to acknowledging that there can be a better way and the next jump-off point might
              not be the same as the last time. So, in many implicit ways, this future is predicated on redesigning
              the past and remaining fluid and adaptable to change.

          <p>I am a student in Thinkful’s Engineering FLEX program. I pride myself on thoroughly learning terminology, 
            concepts, methods, and application. Analyzing others’ projects has been instrumental in creating my own 
            internal database of what clean dynamic code should look like utilizing meticulous syntax. I take a 
            minimalist approach in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript believing that change tolerance and readability makes 
            later revision far easier. I am perpetually learning, always malleable.</p>
          <p>I'm a recreation seeker in the wide outdoor world. Mountains, oceans, cycling, kayaking, boomeranging, 
            skiing, and outdoor live entertainment are all adventures I pursue. Having moved to North Carolina from 
            Illinois recently, my access to nature has been restored. I was raised by artists. My father a painter
            and my mother classically trained in piano and opera, I have an affinity for fine art of all kinds.
            As my practice in web development has overlapped into my personal life, I see many more possibilities
            in implementing it in my personal endeavors. I hope to bind my passions, personal and professional, 
            together in the future.
